                    <h4>Local Storage: </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Local storage works, appears, and similar to session storage. For instance, just like Session storage, local storage can also store data ranging between 5mb - 10mb depending upon a browser's implementation.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Data Persistence : </b>Unlike session storage where data is automatically deleted when a browser tab or window is closed, data in local storage has no default expiry. It's only deleted if you manually delete that data from the local storage either directly, via browser settings, or through your JavaScript code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Using Local Storage: </b>
                            You can add and retrieve data from local storage in the same way you perform those operations with session storage. The only change is now you'll have to use the localStorage object to perform these operations instead.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <!-- Session Storage: -->
                    <h4>Session Storage: </h4>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Session storage can store data ranging between 5mb - 10mb. The exact amount of storage capacity varies as per each browser's implementation, but it's a lot more than 4kb of storage capacity cookies offer!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Data Persistence: </b>As the name suggests, session storage only persists the data as long as a browser tab is opened. This means that each time you open a new tab or a new browser window, a new session storage is created. So any data you store inside the session storage will automatically get deleted when you close that tab/window.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Using Session Storage: </b>This would return the length of the session storage along with an object representing the data that's currently present inside. Since it's empty to begin with, the length is 0. Note that you may directly access the sessionStorage object as well.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</li>
                        <li><b>For Exmaple: </b> 
                            <pre>

                    <!-- Block Scope -->
                    <h4>Block Scope: </h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
